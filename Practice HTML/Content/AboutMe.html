        <p class="left">Hello I'm Luke Herron. I'm doing this assignment for IS 200 and I'm trying <br> to learn the material really well
            so that I can do well on the homework. I like <br>to study and I like IS, but I'm actually studying accounting, it is what
            I want to do after I graduate.
        </p>
